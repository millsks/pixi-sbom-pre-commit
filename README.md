# pixi-sbom-pre-commit

[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks for [pixi-sbom](https://github.com/millsks/pixi-sbom). Generated from
pixi-sbom's `pre-commit-mirror/` on each release; issues and changes go to that repository. Each tag here installs
the pixi-sbom wheel of the same version from PyPI, so nothing is compiled.

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/millsks/pixi-sbom-pre-commit
    rev: v1.9.0
    hooks:
      # Write sbom.cdx.json next to the lockfile whenever a lockfile changes.
      - id: pixi-sbom
      # The license gate, with your policy.
      - id: pixi-sbom-policy
        args: [--deny-license, GPL-3.0-only]
```

The hooks run when `pixi.lock`, `uv.lock`, `pylock.toml`, `poetry.lock`, `pdm.lock` or `conda-lock.yml` changes,
reading the lockfile the way `pixi-sbom` finds it from the repository root; `args:` passes any other flag
(`--scan .` for a monorepo, `--format spdx`). A rerun that would change nothing but the document's timestamp leaves
the file alone, so the hook only fails when the SBOM really changed. See the
[pre-commit section of the docs](https://millsks.github.io/pixi-sbom/latest/ci-recipes/#pre-commit).
